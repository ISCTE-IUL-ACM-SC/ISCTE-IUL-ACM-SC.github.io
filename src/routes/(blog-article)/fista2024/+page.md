## February 28-29, 2024: ISCTE-IUL ACM Student Chapter at FISTA Forum

On February 28-29, 2024, the ISCTE-IUL ACM Student Chapter was once again present at the yearly FISTA Forum.

FISTA, organized by ISTA – Escola de Tecnologias e Arquitetura, is a yearly networking forum held on the ISCTE-IUL campus. This event hosted 88 corporations of various sizes, such as Deloitte, Vodafone, CGI, and KPMG, and included institution-led activities such as technology workshops, CTF challenges, and architecture conferences.

In its 11th edition, the ACM Student Chapter showcased its activities, ongoing and completed projects, and plans for the future. The chapter also raised 30 applications from interested alumni over the course of the two days.
